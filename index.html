        <p class="w3-center w3-text-my-green">
          A ceremonial-style matcha is like espresso: a concentrated, premium
          product enjoyed in smaller quantities. As such, you only need about ½
          teaspoon of powdered tea (two scoops from the chashaku) in order to
          make a single serving. Sift your matcha into a small bowl to remove
          any clumps. Then add two ounces of water at 176°F. Whisk to fully
          dissolve and incorporate the powder and to give you a creamy, velvety,
          and foam-topped cup. Once you have the basics down, you can adjust the
          amount of powder to your taste preference.
